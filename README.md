Discriptions for the files:

'03.longorf.glimmer','08.longorf.glimmer','09.longorf.glimmer','18.longorf.glimmer' are the correspongding genes generated by Glimmer;  '03.longorf.glimmer.oneline','08.longorf.glimmer.oneline','09.longorf.glimmer.oneline','18.longorf.glimmer.oneline' are the same genes without '\n' in one gene (the sequence of the same gene is written in one line).

'03.predictedgenes.50.fa' is the predicted gene sequences by our own code, with orf length threshold=50. '03.predictedgenes.100-1.fa' is the multifasta file of predicted gene sequences with orf length threshold=100. '-1' means it starts to read from the first position of the genome. For species 03, all the three reading frames give the same result.
