Final Project
1. Content of A, T, C, G and GC content
   Content of 16 dinucleotides: **consider both reading frames
   content of 20 amino acids and 400 di-amino acids

-  consider 2 reading frames
- bash script to inspect the large genome files
- decide whether undefined nucleotide (those are non-ATCG) should be included

2. ORF finder
- Principle: 6 open reading frames, start codon and stop codons, length, non-overlapping
- Probability model?
- For eukaryotes?

3. Comparison with GLIMMER HMM:
- number of genes
- length of genes (histogram)
- amino acid composition
- coverage

4. Distance matrix
- use statistics from 1 
- literature search, decide which one should be used (can be deduced phylogenic tree)
