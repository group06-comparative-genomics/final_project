Hi,

Just to clarify. Everyone needs to submit a final assignment report (min 2 - max 5 pages).
This report describes your final assignment only (more detail in document final assignment):
- Frequencies
- ORF finder
- Trees

Additionally, you need to give a presentation:
Presentation consists of two parts:
1) Starts with short overview, what genomes, what you learned about them during practicals
2) Should be about your final assignment (this may overlap with your final assignment report)

Each group presents 15-30min, with 10min for presenting final assignment.
